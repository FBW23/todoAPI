## TODO API

This is a small todo API.

##### STEPS

1.  Generate a project using the express generator package -> `npm express-generator todoAPI -no-view --git`

2.  Connect the project to a git repo.
3.  Set up the process we would like our requests to follow. The request comes in app.js, it then gets redirected to the right router and the router calls the correct controller method based on the type of the request (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PLAMEN)
